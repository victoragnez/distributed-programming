**RMI generic task** is a Java RMI application which the server can compute anything to the client and return the result object using generic type.

**RMI Sort** is a Java RMI application which the server offers 11 different sorting algorithms, returning the sorted array and the elapsed time.

**SortAPI** is similar to the **RMI Sort**, but it's a RESTful web service with JAX-RS (using Jersey framework), and the client was developed in C++ with the Microsoft project C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca").
